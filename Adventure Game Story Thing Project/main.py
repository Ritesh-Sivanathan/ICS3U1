Description: (below)

--- Story ---

Inspired by John Grisham's `The Firm`, `The King of Torts` and a little bit of `The Broker`

A lawyer finds damning evidence against a large pharmaceutical company. Before he can litigate, he is approached by a corporate fixer, 
who offers him a bribe. His entire life is at risk no matter what choice he makes

There are 5 possible outcomes
- Accepts Bribe + Survives Attacks
- Accepts Bribe + Doesn't Surive Attacks (dies or goes to prison)
- Declines Bribe + Successfully takes down the pharmaceutical
- Declines Bribe + Fails to take the pharmaceutical down and is countersued for everything
- Declies Bribe + Runs away to another country
